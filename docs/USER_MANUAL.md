## Tips & Best Practices

### Design Tips

1. **Start with a Template**: Use predefined templates as starting points - they're professionally designed and tested.

2. **Use Headers and Footers**: Always include a header with your logo and a footer with unsubscribe links for professional emails.

3. **Add Social Links**: Include social media icons in your emails to grow your following.

4. **Keep it Simple**: Don't overcrowd your email. Use spacers to create breathing room.

5. **Mobile-Friendly**: Test your email on mobile devices. The builder creates responsive designs, but always preview before sending.

6. **Use Columns Wisely**: Columns are great for newsletters, but keep them to 2-3 columns maximum for readability.

7. **Button Best Practices**:
   - Use clear, action-oriented text (e.g., "Shop Now", "Learn More")
   - Make buttons prominent with contrasting colors
   - One primary button per email is usually best

8. **Image Guidelines**:
   - Use high-quality images
   - Optimize images for web (keep file sizes reasonable)
   - Always include alt text for accessibility
   - Use absolute URLs (full web addresses, not relative paths)

### Content Tips

1. **Clear Subject Lines**: While not part of the builder, remember to write compelling subject lines.

2. **Personalization**: Use merge tags from your email service provider for personalization.

3. **Call-to-Action**: Make your primary action button prominent and easy to find.

4. **Unsubscribe Link**: Always include an unsubscribe link in your footer (required by law in many regions).

## Troubleshooting

### Block Not Appearing

**Problem**: You dragged a block but it's not showing on the canvas.

**Solution**: 
- Make sure you're dropping it on the canvas area (center section)
- Try refreshing the page
- Check that the block was actually added (it might be below the visible area)

### Can't Edit Block Properties

**Problem**: The right sidebar is empty or not showing properties.

**Solution**:
- Make sure you've clicked on a block to select it
- Look for the blue border around the selected block
- Try clicking the block again

### Image Not Showing

**Problem**: Image shows as broken or placeholder.

**Solution**:
- Check that the image URL is correct and complete (must start with http:// or https://)
- Ensure the image is publicly accessible (not behind a login)
- Try opening the image URL in a new browser tab to verify it works
- Use absolute URLs (full web addresses), not relative paths

### Can't Delete a Block

**Problem**: Block won't delete when dragged outside.

**Solution**:
- Make sure you're dragging it completely outside the canvas area
- Try using the delete button in the right sidebar instead
- Select the block first, then click the trash icon

### Changes Not Saving

**Problem**: Your edits disappear when you refresh.

**Solution**:
- This depends on how the application is configured
- Check with your developer/administrator about saving functionality
- Consider exporting your template as JSON to save it manually

### Template Not Loading

**Problem**: Selected template doesn't appear.

**Solution**:
- Wait a moment for the template to load
- Try selecting the template again
- Refresh the page and try again

### Social Links Not Working

**Problem**: Social media icons don't link correctly.

**Solution**:
- Check that you've entered complete URLs (starting with https://)
